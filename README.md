# Advent of Code 2018 Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar for Programmers put on by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) (The Vanilla-JS guy). For the 25 days up to Christmas, there is a new programming puzzle each day. Each day there is a single puzzle that has two stages where you learn about the puzzle and solve part 1, and then part 2 slightly mixes it up with a little more of a challenge.
